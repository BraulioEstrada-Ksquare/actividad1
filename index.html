                    <h4>Biography</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sir Brian Harold May CBE (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician and astrophysicist. He achieved worldwide fame as the lead guitarist of the rock band Queen, which he co-founded with the singer Freddie Mercury and the drummer Roger Taylor. His guitar work and songwriting contributions helped Queen become one of the most successful acts in music history.

                        May studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and ARCS in physics with Upper Second-Class Honours. From 1970 to 1974, he studied for a PhD degree at Imperial College. When Queen began to have international success in 1974, he abandoned his doctoral studies.

                        In October 2006, May re-registered for his doctorate at Imperial College, and he submitted his thesis in August 2007 . As well as writing up the previous work he had done, May had to review the work on zodiacal dust undertaken during the intervening 33 years, which included the discovery of the zodiacal dust bands by NASA's IRAS satellite. After a viva voce, the revised thesis was approved in September 2007, some 37 years after it had been commenced
